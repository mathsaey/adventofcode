# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Inputs are omitted as these are available on the advent of code site.

You may also be useful in the [advent of code
utilities](https://github.com/mathsaey/advent_of_code_utils),
a set of mix tasks and macros to automatically fetch input and streamline the
entire process.
