# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Inputs are omitted as these are available on the advent of code site.

# AOC Module

Besides my solutions, this repository contains the AOC module.
This module contains a macro, `aoc`, that automatically generates a module named
based on the provided day and year. Besides this, it provides the `input` function
which automatically loads an input file in the correct location as a Stream of
strings.
